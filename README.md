# Stock-Manager--Python

This project is a Stock Manager built using Python's tkinter library and connected to an SQL server for data storage.

## Introduction

The Stock Manager is a software application that helps manage inventory, sales, and orders of products. In this project, we will build a Stock Manager using Python's tkinter library for the user interface and an SQL server for data storage.

## Requirements
To run the code in this project, you will need the following libraries and tools installed:

Python 3.x
Tkinter
Pyodbc
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install tkinter pyodbc
You will also need an SQL server installed on your system or access to a remote SQL server.
